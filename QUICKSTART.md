# Quick Start

Get the oshankhz-claude-code plugin running in **under 2 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured

## Installation

Run these commands **inside Claude Code** (not in your terminal):

### 1. Add the Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add OshanKHZ/oshankhz-claude-code
```

### 2. Install the Plugin

```
/plugin install oshankhz-claude-code
```

## Verify It Works

Ask Claude:

```
Create a skill for me
```

If the skill-development skill activates and Claude starts guiding you through skill creation, the installation worked.
